Codsoft Internship - Credit Card Fraud Detection
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am currently an intern at Codsoft, participating in their machine learning internship program. This repository contains my first project: Credit Card Fraud Detection.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop models that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used is entirely text-based, which presented some challenges in data processing.

Models and Performance
Several machine learning models were developed and evaluated for this task:

Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 0.97
Decision Tree Classifier
Accuracy: 0.96
Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 0.80
Tuned Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 0.97
